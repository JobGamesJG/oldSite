				"text": "Hi, I'm Job, 14 year-old programmer from the Netherlands. The “computer nerd” of the family if you don't count my brother then😶. I began programming when I was 12 and I haven't stopped ever since. I sleep a lot during the day, but at night😅, I watch a lot of anime or play games. I also like to take pictures or to do sports, the sport i do is hockey and I'm pretty good at it. That's all I wanna say about my live🐒👍🏾. Do you want to see pictures i took📷? click on the pictures below.",
